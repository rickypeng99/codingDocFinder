Java - Documentation Comments
The Java language supports three types of comments −
/* text */
The compiler ignores everything from /* to */.
//text
The compiler ignores everything from // to the end of the line.
/** documentation */ 
This is a documentation comment and in general its called doc comment. The JDK javadoc tool uses doc comments when preparing automatically generated documentation.
This chapter is all about explaining Javadoc. We will see how we can make use of Javadoc to generate useful documentation for Java code.
What is Javadoc?
Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code, which requires documentation in a predefined format.
Following is a simple example where the lines inside /*….*/ are Java multi-line comments. Similarly, the line which preceeds // is Java single-line comment.
You can include required HTML tags inside the description part. For instance, the following example makes use of <h1>....</h1> for heading and <p> has been used for creating paragraph break −
The javadoc Tags
The javadoc tool recognizes the following tags −
Example
Following program uses few of the important tags available for documentation comments. You can make use of other tags based on your requirements.
The documentation about the AddNum class will be produced in HTML file AddNum.html but at the same time a master file with a name index.html will also be created.
Now, process the above AddNum.java file using javadoc utility as follows −
You can check all the generated documentation here − AddNum. If you are using JDK 1.7 then javadoc does not generate a great stylesheet.css, so we suggest to download and use standard stylesheet from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/stylesheet.css
