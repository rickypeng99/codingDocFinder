java throw keyword example
In this example, we have created the validate method that takes integer value as a parameter. If the age is less than 18, we are throwing the ArithmeticException otherwise print a message welcome to vote.

public class TestThrow1{
   static void validate(int age){
     if(age<18)
      throw new ArithmeticException("not valid");
     else
      System.out.println("welcome to vote");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
      validate(13);
      System.out.println("rest of the code...");
  }
}

Test it Now
Output:

Exception in thread main java.lang.ArithmeticException:not valid
