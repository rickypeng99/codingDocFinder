Sleep method in java
The sleep() method of Thread class is used to sleep a thread for the specified amount of time.
Syntax of sleep() method in java
The Thread class provides two methods for sleeping a thread:


public static void sleep(long miliseconds)throws InterruptedException


public static void sleep(long miliseconds, int nanos)throws InterruptedException


Example of sleep method in java


class TestSleepMethod1 extends Thread{
 public void run(){
  for(int i=1;i<5;i++){
    try{Thread.sleep(500);}catch(InterruptedException e){System.out.println(e);}
    System.out.println(i);
  }
 }
 public static void main(String args[]){
  TestSleepMethod1 t1=new TestSleepMethod1();
  TestSleepMethod1 t2=new TestSleepMethod1();
 
  t1.start();
  t2.start();
 }
}

Output:

       1
       1
       2
       2
       3
       3
       4
       4

As you know well that at a time only one thread is executed. If you sleep a thread for the specified time,the thread shedular picks up another thread and so on.
