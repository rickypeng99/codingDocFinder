Java FileReader Example
In this example, we are reading the data from the text file 
testout.txt
 using Java FileReader class.

package com.javatpoint;

import java.io.FileReader;
public class FileReaderExample {
	public static void main(String args[])throws Exception{  
		  FileReader fr=new FileReader("D:\\testout.txt");  
		  int i;  
		  while((i=fr.read())!=-1)  
		  System.out.print((char)i);  
		  fr.close();  
	}  
}  

Here, we are assuming that you have following data in "testout.txt" file:

Welcome to javaTpoint.

Output:

Welcome to javaTpoint.
