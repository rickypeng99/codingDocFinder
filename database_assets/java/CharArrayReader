Example of CharArrayReader Class:
Let's see the simple example to read a character using Java CharArrayReader class.

package com.javatpoint;

import java.io.CharArrayReader;
public class CharArrayExample{
  public static void main(String[] ag) throws Exception {
    char[] ary = { 'j', 'a', 'v', 'a', 't', 'p', 'o', 'i', 'n', 't' };
    CharArrayReader reader = new CharArrayReader(ary);
    int k = 0;
    // Read until the end of a file
    while ((k = reader.read()) != -1) {
      char ch = (char) k;
      System.out.print(ch + " : ");
      System.out.println(k);
    }
  }
}


Output

j : 106
a : 97
v : 118
a : 97
t : 116
p : 112
o : 111
i : 105
n : 110
t : 116
