Java Database Connectivity with Oracle


To connect java application with the oracle database, we need to follow 5 following steps.
 In this example, we are using Oracle 10g as the database. So we need to know following information for the oracle database:



Driver class: 
 The driver  class for the oracle database is 
oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
.


Connection  URL: 
 The connection URL for the oracle10G database is 
jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
 where  jdbc is the API, oracle is the database, thin is the driver, localhost is the server name on which oracle is running, we may also use IP address, 1521 is the port number and XE is the Oracle service name. You may get  all these information from the tnsnames.ora file. 


Username: 
 The default username for the oracle database is 
system
.


Password: 
 It is the password given by the user at the time of installing the oracle database.










Create a Table

Before establishing connection, let's first create a table in oracle database. Following is the SQL query to create a table.





create table emp(id number(10),name varchar2(40),age number(3));



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Example to Connect Java Application with Oracle database
In this example, we are connecting to an Oracle database and getting data from 
emp
 table. Here, 
system
 and 
oracle
 are the username and password of the Oracle database.


import java.sql.*;
class OracleCon{
public static void main(String args[]){
try{
//step1 load the driver class
Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");

//step2 create  the connection object
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(
"jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe","system","oracle");

//step3 create the statement object
Statement stmt=con.createStatement();

//step4 execute query
ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp");
while(rs.next())
System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+"  "+rs.getString(2)+"  "+rs.getString(3));

//step5 close the connection object
con.close();

}catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(e);}

}
}

The above example will fetch all the records of emp table.


To connect java application with the Oracle database ojdbc14.jar file is required to be loaded.



download the jar file ojdbc14.jar


Two ways to load the jar file:


paste the ojdbc14.jar file in jre/lib/ext folder


set classpath


1) paste the ojdbc14.jar file in JRE/lib/ext folder:


Firstly, search the ojdbc14.jar file then go to JRE/lib/ext folder and paste the jar file here. 



2) set classpath:


There are two ways to set the classpath:



temporary


permanent






How to set the temporary classpath:


Firstly, search the ojdbc14.jar file then open command prompt and write:





C:>set classpath=c:\folder\ojdbc14.jar;.;


How to set the permanent classpath:
Go to environment variable then click on new tab. In variable name write 
classpath
 and in variable value paste the path to ojdbc14.jar by appending ojdbc14.jar;.; as C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\jdbc\lib\ojdbc14.jar;.;
