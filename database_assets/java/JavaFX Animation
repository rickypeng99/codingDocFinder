JavaFX Animation
In general, the animation can be defined as the transition which creates the myth of motion for an object. It is the set of transformations applied on an object over the specified duration sequentially so that the object can be shown as it is in motion. 
This can be done by the rapid display of frames. In JavaFX, the package 
javafx.animation
 contains all the classes to apply the animations onto the nodes. All the classes of this package extend the class 
javafx.animation.Animation.
JavaFX provides the classes for the transitions like RotateTransition, ScaleTransition, TranslateTransition, FadeTransition, FillTransition, StrokeTransition, etc.
Basic Transitions 
The package 
javafx.animation
 provides the classes for performing the following transitions.

Description





    
1

    
Rotate Transition 

    
Rotate the Node along one of the axes over the specified duration.





    
2

    
Scale Transition

    
Animate the scaling of the node over the specified duration.





    
3

    
Translate Transition 

    
Translate the node from one position to another over the specified duration. 





    
4

    
Fade Transition 

    
Animate the opacity of the node. It keeps updating the opacity of the node over a specified duration in order to reach a target opacity value 





    
5

    
Fill Transition

    
Animate the node's fill color so that the fill color of the node fluctuates between the two color values over the specified duration. 





    
6

    
Stroke Transition 

    
Animate the node's stroke color so that the stroke color of the node fluctuates between the two color values over the specified duration. 





    
7

    
Perform the list of transitions on a node in the sequential order.  

    





    
8

    
Parallel Transition 

    
Perform the list of transitions on a node in parallel.  





    
9

    
Path Transition

    
Move the node along the specified path over the specified duration. 




Steps for applying Animations 


Create the target node and configure its properties.

    

    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(120,100,100,100); 
    rect.setFill(Color.RED);
    

    


Instantiate the respective transition class



  RotateTransition rotate = new RotateTransition();
    

    


Set the desired properties like duration, cycle-count, etc. for the transition.

   

    rotate.setDuration(Duration.millis(1000)); 
    rotate.setAxis(Rotate.Y_Axis);
    rotate.setCycleCount(500); 
    

    


Set the target node on which the transition will be applied. Use the following method for this purpose. 



   rotate.setNode(rect);
    

    


Finally, play the transition using the play() method. 



  rotate.play();
