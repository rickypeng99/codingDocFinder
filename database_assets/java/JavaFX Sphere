JavaFX Sphere
In general, sphere can be defined as a round 3D object with every point on its surface equidistant from its centre. A sphere can be seen as a Circle created in a 3 dimensional plane where every coordinate contains an extra dimension Z.
The examples of Sphere in the real world are globe, ball,  etc. In JavaFX, Sphere is represented by the class 
javafx.scene.shape.Sphere
. We just need to instantiate this class in order to create the sphere. A sphere is shown in the following image.
Properties
The properties of the class along with their setter methods are described in the following table.

radius

	
It is a double type property. It represents the radius of the sphere. 

	
SetRadius(double radius)




Constructors
There are the three constructors 


public Sphere() :
 creates a new instance of sphere of radius 1.0


public Sphere(double radius) :
 creates a new instance of sphere with the specified radius. 


public Sphere(double radius, int divisions) :
 creates a new instance of sphere with the specified radius and divisions.
