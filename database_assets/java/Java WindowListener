}
public void windowActivated(WindowEvent arg0) {

}
public void windowClosed(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("closed");
}
public void windowClosing(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("closing");
	dispose();
}
public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("deactivated");
}
public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("deiconified");
}
public void windowIconified(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("iconified");
}
public void windowOpened(WindowEvent arg0) {
	System.out.println("opened");
}
}

Output:
