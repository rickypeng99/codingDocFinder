JavaFX Polygons
Polygon can be defined as a plain figure with at least three straight sides forming a loop. In the case of polygons, we mainly considers the length of its sides and the interior angles. Triangles, squares, Pentagons, Hexagons,etc are all polygons.
In JavaFX, Polygon can be created by instantiating 
javafx.scene.shape.Polygon
 class. We need to pass a Double array into the class constructor representing X-Y coordinates of all the points of the polygon. The syntax is given below.

Polygon poly = new Polygon(DoubleArray); 

We can also create polygon by anonymously calling 
addAll()
 method on the reference returned by calling 
getPoints()
 method which is an instance method of Polygon class. However, we need to pass the double array into this method, which represents X-Y coordinates of the polygon. The syntax is given below.

Pollygon polygon_object = new Pollygon();
Pollygon_Object.getPoints().addAll(Double_Array);

Example:
The following example creates a polygon with three sides.

package application;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.shape.Polygon;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
public class Shape_Example extends Application {

  @Override
  public void start(Stage primarystage) {
    Group root = new Group();
    primarystage.setTitle("Pollygon Example");
    
    Polygon polygon = new Polygon();
    polygon.getPoints().addAll(new Double[]{
        0.0, 0.0,
        100.0, 200.0,
        200.0, 100.0 });
    
    root.getChildren().add(polygon);
    Scene scene = new Scene(root,300,400);
    primarystage.setScene(scene);
    primarystage.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
  }
}
