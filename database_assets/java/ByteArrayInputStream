Java ByteArrayInputStream Class
The ByteArrayInputStream is composed of two words: ByteArray and InputStream. As the name suggests, it can be used to read byte 
array
 as input stream.
Java ByteArrayInputStream 
class
 contains an internal buffer which is used to 
read byte array
 as stream. In this stream, the data is read from a byte array.
The buffer of ByteArrayInputStream automatically grows according to data.
Java ByteArrayInputStream class declaration
Let's see the declaration for Java.io.ByteArrayInputStream class:

public class ByteArrayInputStream extends InputStream

Java ByteArrayInputStream class constructors

    

       
Constructor

       
Description

    

    

       
ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] ary)

       
Creates a new byte array input stream which uses 
ary
 as its buffer array.

    

    

       
ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] ary, int offset, int len)

       
Creates a new byte array input stream which uses 
ary
 as its buffer array that can read up to specified 
len
 bytes of data from an array.

Methods

       
Description

    

    

       
int available()

       
It is used to return the number of remaining bytes that can be read from the input stream.

    

    

       
int read()

       
It is used to read the next byte of data from the input stream.

    

    

       
int read(byte[] ary, int off, int len)

       
It is used to read up to len bytes of data from an array of bytes in the input stream.

    

    

       
boolean markSupported()

       
It is used to test the input stream for mark and reset method.

    

    

       
long skip(long x)

       
It is used to skip the x bytes of input from the input stream.

    

    

       
void mark(int readAheadLimit)

       
It is used to set the current marked position in the stream.

    

    

       
void reset()

       
It is used to reset the buffer of a byte array.

    

    

        
void close()

        
It is used for closing a ByteArrayInputStream.

Example of Java ByteArrayInputStream
Let's see a simple example of 
java
 ByteArrayInputStream class to read byte array as input stream.

package com.javatpoint;
import java.io.*;
public class ReadExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    byte[] buf = { 35, 36, 37, 38 };
    // Create the new byte array input stream
    ByteArrayInputStream byt = new ByteArrayInputStream(buf);
    int k = 0;
    while ((k = byt.read()) != -1) {
      //Conversion of a byte into character
      char ch = (char) k;
      System.out.println("ASCII value of Character is:" + k + "; Special character is: " + ch);
    }
  }
}

Output:

ASCII value of Character is:35; Special character is: #
ASCII value of Character is:36; Special character is: $
ASCII value of Character is:37; Special character is: %
ASCII value of Character is:38; Special character is: &
