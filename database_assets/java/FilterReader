Example
In this example, we are using "javaFile123.txt" file which contains "India is my country" text in it. Here, we are converting whitespace  with question mark '?'.

import java.io.*;
class CustomFilterReader extends FilterReader {
	CustomFilterReader(Reader in) {
		super(in);
	}
	public int read() throws IOException {
		int x = super.read();
		if ((char) x == ' ')
			return ((int) '?');
		else
			return x;
	}
}
public class FilterReaderExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try  {
			Reader reader = new FileReader("javaFile123.txt");
			CustomFilterReader fr = new CustomFilterReader(reader);
			int i;
			while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
				System.out.print((char) i);
			}
            fr.close();
            reader.close();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.getMessage();
		}
	}
}

Output:

India?is?my?country
