Thread Scheduler in Java
Thread scheduler
 in java is the part of the JVM that decides which thread should run.
There is no guarantee that which runnable thread will be chosen to run by the thread scheduler.
Only one thread at a time can run in a single process.
The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.
Difference between preemptive scheduling and time slicing
Under preemptive scheduling, the highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead states or a higher priority task comes into existence. Under time slicing, a task executes for a predefined slice of time and then reenters the pool of ready tasks. The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factors.
