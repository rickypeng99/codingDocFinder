Creating API Document | javadoc tool
We can create document api in java by the help of 
javadoc
 tool. In the java file, we must use the documentation comment /**...  */ to post information for the class, method, constructor, fields etc.
Let's see the simple class that contains documentation comment.


package com.abc;
/** This class is a user-defined class that contains one methods cube.*/
public class M{

/** The cube method prints cube of the given number */
public static void  cube(int n){System.out.println(n*n*n);}
}

To create the document API, you need to use the javadoc tool followed by java file name. There is no need to compile the javafile.
On the command prompt, you need to write:

javadoc M.java

to generate the document api. Now, there will be created a lot of html files. Open the index.html file to get the information about the classes.
