Java Reader
Java
 Reader is an  
abstract class
 for reading character  
streams
. The only methods that a subclass must implement are read(char[], int, int) and close(). Most subclasses, however, will 
override
 some of the methods  to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.
Some of the implementation 
class
 are 
BufferedReader
, 
CharArrayReader
, 
FilterReader
, 
InputStreamReader
, PipedReader, 
StringReader

public class ReaderExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			Reader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
			int data = reader.read();
			while (data != -1) {
