Difference between method overloading and method overriding in java
There are many differences between method overloading and method overriding in java. A list of differences between method overloading and method overriding are given below:


No.
Method Overloading 
Method Overriding


1)
Method overloading is used 
to increase the readability
 of the program.
Method overriding is used 
to provide the specific implementation
 of the method that is already provided by its super class.


2)
Method overloading is performed 
within class
.
Method overriding occurs 
in two classes
 that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.


3)
In case of method overloading, 
parameter must be different
.
In case of method overriding, 
parameter must be same
.


4)
Method overloading is the example of 
compile time polymorphism
.
Method overriding is the example of 
run time polymorphism
.


5)
In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return type of the method only. 
Return type can be same or different
 in method overloading. But you must have to change the parameter.
Return type must be same or covariant
 in method overriding.

Java Method Overloading example

class OverloadingExample{
static int add(int a,int b){return a+b;}
static int add(int a,int b,int c){return a+b+c;}
}

Java Method Overriding example

class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating bread...");}
}
