JavaFX Scale Transition
This transition animates the scaling of the node over the specified duration by the specified factor  in any or all of the three directions X, Y, and Z.
In JavaFX, ScaleTransition is represented by the class 
javafx.animation.ScaleTransition.
 We need to instantiate this class in order to generate an appropriate scale transition.
Properties 
The properties of the class along with their setter methods are described in the following table.

Constructors
There are three constructors in the class.


public TranslateTransition() :
 creates the new instance of TranslateTransition with the default parameters.


public TranslateTransition(Duration duration) :
 creates the new instance of TranslateTransition with the specified duration.
 

public TranslateTransition(Duration duration, Node node) :
 creates the new instance of Translate Transition with the specified duration and node.


Example
In the following example, we have made a circle translating itself by 400 in the X direction. 

 package application;
import javafx.animation.TranslateTransition;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.paint.Color;
import javafx.scene.shape.Circle;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import javafx.util.Duration;
public class Translate_Transition extends Application{

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        //Creating the circle 
        Circle cir = new Circle(50,100,50);
        
        //setting color and stroke of the cirlce
        cir.setFill(Color.RED);
        cir.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
        
        //Instantiating TranslateTransition class 
        TranslateTransition translate = new TranslateTransition();
        
        //shifting the X coordinate of the centre of the circle by 400 
        translate.setByX(400);
        
        //setting the duration for the Translate transition 
        translate.setDuration(Duration.millis(1000));
        
        //setting cycle count for the Translate transition 
        translate.setCycleCount(500);
        
        //the transition will set to be auto reversed by setting this to true 
        translate.setAutoReverse(true);
        
        //setting Circle as the node onto which the transition will be applied
        translate.setNode(cir);
        
        //playing the transition 
        translate.play();
        
        //Configuring Group and Scene 
        Group root = new Group();
        root.getChildren().addAll(cir);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root,500,200,Color.WHEAT);
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.setTitle("Translate Transition example");
        primaryStage.show();
        
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

}
