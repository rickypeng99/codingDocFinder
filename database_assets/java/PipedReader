The PipedReader class is used to read the contents of a pipe as a stream of characters. This 
class
 is used generally  to read text.

Description

    

    

        
PipedReader(int pipeSize)

        
It creates a PipedReader so that it is not yet connected and uses the specified pipe size for the pipe's buffer.

    

    

        
PipedReader(PipedWriter src)

        
It creates a PipedReader so that it is connected to the piped writer src.

    

    

        
PipedReader(PipedWriter src, int pipeSize)

        
It creates a PipedReader so that it is connected to the piped writer src and uses the specified pipe size for the pipe's buffer.

    

    

        
PipedReader()

        
It creates a PipedReader so that it is not yet connected.

void

        
close()

void

        
connect(PipedWriter src)

        
It causes this piped reader to be connected to the piped writer src.

    

    

        
int

        
read()

        
It reads the next character of data from this piped stream. 

    

    

        
int

        
read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)

        
It reads up to len characters of data from this piped stream into an 
array
 of characters.

    

    

        
boolean

        
ready()

        
It tells whether this stream is ready to be read.

    


Example

import java.io.PipedWriter;

public class PipeReaderExample2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {

			final PipedReader read = new PipedReader();
			final PipedWriter write = new PipedWriter(read);

			Thread readerThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
				public void run() {
					try {
						int data = read.read();
						while (data != -1) {
							System.out.print((char) data);
							data = read.read();
						}
					} catch (Exception ex) {
					}
				}
			});

			Thread writerThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
				public void run() {
					try {
						write.write("I love my country\n".toCharArray());
					} catch (Exception ex) {
					}
				}
			});

			readerThread.start();
			writerThread.start();

		} catch (Exception ex) {
