/** The Calculator class provides methods to get addition and subtraction of given 2 numbers.*/
public class Calculator {
/** The add() method returns addition of given numbers.*/
public static int add(int a, int b){return a+b;}
/** The sub() method returns subtraction of given numbers.*/
public static int sub(int a, int b){return a-b;}
