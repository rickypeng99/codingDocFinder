Java Database Connectivity with MySQL
To connect Java application with the MySQL database, we need to follow 5 following steps.


In this example we are using MySql as the database. So we need to know following informations for the mysql database:


Driver class: 
 The driver class for the mysql database is 
com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
.


Connection  URL: 
 The connection URL for the mysql database is 
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sonoo
 where  jdbc is the API, mysql is the database, localhost is the server name on which mysql is running, we may also use IP address, 3306 is the port number and sonoo is the database name. We may use any database, in such case, we need to replace the sonoo with our database name.



Username: 
 The default username for the mysql database is 
root
.


Password: 
 It is the password given by the user at the time of installing the mysql database. In this example, we are going to use root as the password.


Let's first create a table in the mysql database, but before creating table, we need to create database first.


create database sonoo;
use sonoo;
create table emp(id int(10),name varchar(40),age int(3));



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Example to Connect Java Application with mysql database
In this example, sonoo is the database name, root is the username and password both.

import java.sql.*;
class MysqlCon{
public static void main(String args[]){
try{
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sonoo","root","root");
//here sonoo is database name, root is username and password
Statement stmt=con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp");
while(rs.next())
System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+"  "+rs.getString(2)+"  "+rs.getString(3));
con.close();
}catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(e);}
}
}



download this example



The above example will fetch all the records of emp table.


To connect java application with the mysql database, 
mysqlconnector.jar
 file is required to be loaded.



download the jar file mysql-connector.jar


Two ways to load the jar file:


Paste the mysqlconnector.jar file in jre/lib/ext folder


Set classpath


1) Paste the mysqlconnector.jar file in JRE/lib/ext folder:


Download the mysqlconnector.jar file. Go to jre/lib/ext folder and paste the jar file here. 



2) Set classpath:


There are two ways to set the classpath:



temporary


permanent






How to set the temporary classpath


open command prompt and write:





C:>set classpath=c:\folder\mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar;.;


How to set the permanent classpath
Go to environment variable then click on new tab. In variable name write 
classpath
 and in variable value paste the path to the mysqlconnector.jar file by appending mysqlconnector.jar;.; as C:\folder\mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar;.;
