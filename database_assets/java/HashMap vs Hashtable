Difference between HashMap and Hashtable
HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.
But there are many differences between HashMap and Hashtable classes that are given below.


HashMap
Hashtable


1) HashMap is 
non synchronized
. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.
Hashtable is 
synchronized
. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.


2) HashMap 
allows one null key and multiple null values
.
Hashtable 
doesn't allow any null key or value
.


3) HashMap is a 
new class introduced in JDK 1.2
.
Hashtable is a 
legacy class
.


4) HashMap is 
fast
.
Hashtable is 
slow
.


5) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code
 Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);
Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.


6) HashMap is 
traversed by Iterator
.
Hashtable is 
traversed by Enumerator and Iterator
.


7) Iterator in HashMap is 
fail-fast
.
Enumerator in Hashtable is 
not fail-fast
.


8) HashMap inherits 
AbstractMap
 class.
Hashtable inherits 
Dictionary
 class.
