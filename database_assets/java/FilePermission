Java FilePermission Class
Java FilePermission class contains the permission related to a directory or 
file
. All the permissions are related with path. The path can be of two types:
1) 
D:\\IO\\
-: It indicates that the permission is associated with all sub directories and files recursively.
2) 
D:\\IO\\*
: It indicates that the permission is associated with all directory and files within this directory excluding sub directories.
Java FilePermission class declaration
Let's see the declaration for Java.io.FilePermission class:

Java FilePermission Example
Let's see the simple example in which permission of a directory path is granted with read permission and a file of this directory is granted for write permission. 

package com.javatpoint;

import java.io.*;
import java.security.PermissionCollection;
public class FilePermissionExample{
	   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
	    String srg = "D:\\IO Package\\java.txt";
	    FilePermission file1 = new FilePermission("D:\\IO Package\\-", "read");
	    PermissionCollection permission = file1.newPermissionCollection();
	    permission.add(file1);
	         FilePermission file2 = new FilePermission(srg, "write");
	         permission.add(file2);
		     if(permission.implies(new FilePermission(srg, "read,write"))) {
	         System.out.println("Read, Write permission is granted for the path "+srg );
  	         }else {
  	        System.out.println("No Read, Write permission is granted for the path "+srg);  	         }
	   } 
}

Output

Read, Write permission is granted for the path D:\IO Package\java.txt
