Java Static Import
The static import feature of Java 5 facilitate the java programmer to access any static member of a class directly. There is no need to qualify it by the class name.
Advantage of static import:


Less coding is required if you have access any static member of a class oftenly.


Disadvantage of static import:


If you overuse the static import feature, it makes the program unreadable and unmaintainable.


Simple Example of static import

import static java.lang.System.*;  
class StaticImportExample{
  public static void main(String args[]){
   
   out.println("Hello");//Now no need of System.out
   out.println("Java");

 } 
}    

Test it Now

Output:Hello
       Java

What is the difference between import and static import?
