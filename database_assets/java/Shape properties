Setter Methods





	
fill

	
Used to fill the shape with a defined paint. This is a object <paint> type property. 

	
setFill(Paint)





	
smooth

	
This is a boolean type property. If true is passes then the edges of the shape will become smooth. 

	
setSmooth(boolean)





	
strokeDashOffset

	
It defines the distances in the coordinate system which shows the shapes in the dashing patterns. This is a double type property. 

	
setStrokeDashOffset(Double)





	
strokeLineCap

	
It represents the style of the line end cap. It is a strokeLineCap type property. 

	
setStrokeLineCap(StrokeLineCap)





	
strokeLineJoin

	
It represents the style of the joint of the two paths. 

	
setStrokeLineJoin(StrokeLineJoin)





	
strokeMiterLimit

	
It applies the limitation on the distance between the inside and outside points of a joint. It is a double type property.  

	
setStrokeMiterLimit(Double)





	
stroke 

	
It is a colour type property which represents the colour of the boundary line of the shape. 

	
setStroke(paint)





	
strokeType

	
It represents the type of the stroke (where the boundary line will be imposed to the shape) whether inside, outside or centred. 

	
setStrokeType(StrokeType)





	
strokeWidth

	
It represents the width of the stroke. 

	
setStrokeWidth(Double)
