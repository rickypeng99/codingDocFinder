Java OutputStreamWriter
OutputStreamWriter is a 
class
 which is used to convert character stream to byte stream, the characters are encoded into byte using a specified charset. write() method calls the encoding converter which converts the character into bytes. The resulting bytes are then accumulated in a buffer before being written into the underlying output stream. The characters passed to write() methods are not buffered. We optimize the performance of OutputStreamWriter by using it with in a BufferedWriter so that to avoid frequent converter invocation.

Example

public class OutputStreamWriterExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		try {
			OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
			Writer outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream);

			outputStreamWriter.write("Hello World");

			outputStreamWriter.close();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.getMessage();
		}
	}
}

Output:

output.txt file will contains text  "Hello World"
