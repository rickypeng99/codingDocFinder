Example

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try  {
			InputStream stream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
			Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(stream);
			int data = reader.read();
			while (data != -1) {
				System.out.print((char) data);
				data = reader.read();
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}

Output:

I love my country

The file.txt contains text "I love my country" the InputStreamReader
