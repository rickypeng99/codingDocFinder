Java do-while Loop
The Java 
do-while loop
 is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use do-while loop.
The Java 
do-while loop
 is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.
Syntax:

do{
//code to be executed
}while(condition);

Example:

public class DoWhileExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i=1;
    do{
    	System.out.println(i);
    i++;
    }while(i<=10);
}
}

Java Infinitive do-while Loop
If you pass 
true
 in the do-while loop, it will be infinitive do-while loop.
Syntax:

do{
//code to be executed
}while(true);

Example:

public class DoWhileExample2 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	do{
		System.out.println("infinitive do while loop");
	}while(true);
}
}

Output:

infinitive do while loop
infinitive do while loop
infinitive do while loop
ctrl+c

Now, you need to press ctrl+c to exit from the program.
