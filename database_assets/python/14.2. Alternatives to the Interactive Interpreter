14.2. Alternatives to the Interactive InterpreterÂ¶
This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of the
interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the proper
indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if an indent
token is required next).  The completion mechanism might use the interpreterâs
symbol table.  A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses,
quotes, etc., would also be useful.
One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite
some time is IPython, which features tab completion, object exploration and
advanced history management.  It can also be thoroughly customized and embedded
into other applications.  Another similar enhanced interactive environment is
bpython.
