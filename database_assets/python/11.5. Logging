11.5. LoggingÂ¶
The logging module offers a full featured and flexible logging system.
At its simplest, log messages are sent to a file or to sys.stderr:
import logging
logging.debug('Debugging information')
logging.info('Informational message')
logging.warning('Warning:config file %s not found', 'server.conf')
logging.error('Error occurred')
logging.critical('Critical error -- shutting down')


This produces the following output:
WARNING:root:Warning:config file server.conf not found
ERROR:root:Error occurred
CRITICAL:root:Critical error -- shutting down


By default, informational and debugging messages are suppressed and the output
is sent to standard error.  Other output options include routing messages
through email, datagrams, sockets, or to an HTTP Server.  New filters can select
different routing based on message priority: DEBUG,
INFO, WARNING, ERROR,
and CRITICAL.
The logging system can be configured directly from Python or can be loaded from
a user editable configuration file for customized logging without altering the
application.
