12.1. IntroductionÂ¶
Python applications will often use packages and modules that donât
come as part of the standard library.  Applications will sometimes
need a specific version of a library, because the application may
require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be
written using an obsolete version of the libraryâs interface.
This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet
the requirements of every application.  If application A needs version
1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then
the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0
will leave one application unable to run.
The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a
self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a
particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.
Different applications can then use different virtual environments.
To resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements,
application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0
installed while application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0.
If application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will
not affect application Aâs environment.
