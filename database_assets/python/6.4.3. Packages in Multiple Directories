6.4.3. Packages in Multiple DirectoriesÂ¶
Packages support one more special attribute, __path__.  This is
initialized to be a list containing the name of the directory holding the
packageâs __init__.py before the code in that file is executed.  This
variable can be modified; doing so affects future searches for modules and
subpackages contained in the package.
While this feature is not often needed, it can be used to extend the set of
modules found in a package.

[1]In fact function definitions are also âstatementsâ that are âexecutedâ; the
execution of a module-level function definition enters the function name in
the moduleâs global symbol table.
