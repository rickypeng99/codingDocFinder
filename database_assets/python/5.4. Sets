5.4. SetsÂ¶
Python also includes a data type for sets.  A set is an unordered collection
with no duplicate elements.  Basic uses include membership testing and
eliminating duplicate entries.  Set objects also support mathematical operations
like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.  Note: to
create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an
empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.
Here is a brief demonstration:
>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
True
>>> 'crabgrass' in basket
False

>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
...
>>> a = set('abracadabra')
>>> b = set('alacazam')
>>> a                                  # unique letters in a
{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
{'r', 'd', 'b'}
>>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both
{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
{'a', 'c'}
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}


Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions
are also supported:
>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
>>> a
{'r', 'd'}
