5.1.1. Using Lists as StacksÂ¶
The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last
element added is the first element retrieved (âlast-in, first-outâ).  To add an
item to the top of the stack, use append().  To retrieve an item from the
top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.  For example:
>>> stack = [3, 4, 5]
>>> stack.append(6)
>>> stack.append(7)
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> stack.pop()
7
>>> stack
[3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> stack.pop()
6
>>> stack.pop()
5
>>> stack
[3, 4]
