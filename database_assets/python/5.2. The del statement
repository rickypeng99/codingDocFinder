5.2. The del statementÂ¶
There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its
value: the del statement.  This differs from the pop() method
which returns a value.  The del statement can also be used to remove
slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment
of an empty list to the slice).  For example:
>>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[0]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[2:4]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 1234.5]
>>> del a[:]
>>> a
[]


del can also be used to delete entire variables:
>>> del a


Referencing the name a hereafter is an error (at least until another value
is assigned to it).  Weâll find other uses for del later.
