8.7. Predefined Clean-up ActionsÂ¶
Some objects define standard clean-up actions to be undertaken when the object
is no longer needed, regardless of whether or not the operation using the object
succeeded or failed. Look at the following example, which tries to open a file
and print its contents to the screen.
for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end="")


The problem with this code is that it leaves the file open for an indeterminate
amount of time after this part of the code has finished executing.
This is not an issue in simple scripts, but can be a problem for larger
applications. The with statement allows objects like files to be
used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up promptly and correctly.
with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")


After the statement is executed, the file f is always closed, even if a
problem was encountered while processing the lines. Objects which, like files,
provide predefined clean-up actions will indicate this in their documentation.
