10.4. Error Output Redirection and Program TerminationÂ¶
The sys module also has attributes for stdin, stdout, and stderr.
The latter is useful for emitting warnings and error messages to make them
visible even when stdout has been redirected:
>>> sys.stderr.write('Warning, log file not found starting a new one\n')
Warning, log file not found starting a new one


The most direct way to terminate a script is to use sys.exit().
