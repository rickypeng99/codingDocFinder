6.1.2. The Module Search PathÂ¶
When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for
a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file
named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable
sys.path.  sys.path is initialized from these locations:

The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no
file is specified).
PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the
shell variable PATH).
The installation-dependent default.


Note
On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input
script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the
directory containing the symlink is not added to the module search path.

After initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path.  The
directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the
search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that
directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library
directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended.  See section
Standard Modules for more information.
