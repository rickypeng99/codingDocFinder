16.1.2. Executable Python ScriptsÂ¶
On BSDâish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like
shell scripts, by putting the line
#!/usr/bin/env python3.5


(assuming that the interpreter is on the userâs PATH) at the beginning
of the script and giving the file an executable mode.  The #! must be the
first two characters of the file.  On some platforms, this first line must end
with a Unix-style line ending ('\n'), not a Windows ('\r\n') line
ending.  Note that the hash, or pound, character, '#', is used to start a
comment in Python.
The script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the
chmod command.
$ chmod +x myscript.py


On Windows systems, there is no notion of an âexecutable modeâ.  The Python
installer automatically associates .py files with python.exe so that
a double-click on a Python file will run it as a script.  The extension can
also be .pyw, in that case, the console window that normally appears is
suppressed.
