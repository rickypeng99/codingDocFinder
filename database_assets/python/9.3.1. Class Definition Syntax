9.3.1. Class Definition SyntaxÂ¶
The simplest form of class definition looks like this:
class ClassName:
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>


Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be
executed before they have any effect.  (You could conceivably place a class
definition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)
In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function
definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful â weâll
come back to this later.  The function definitions inside a class normally have
a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for
methods â again, this is explained later.
When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the
local scope â thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new
namespace.  In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new
function here.
When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is
created.  This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace
created by the class definition; weâll learn more about class objects in the
next section.  The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class
definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the
class name given in the class definition header (ClassName in the
example).
