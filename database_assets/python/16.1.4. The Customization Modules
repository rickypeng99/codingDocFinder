16.1.4. The Customization ModulesÂ¶
Python provides two hooks to let you customize it: sitecustomize and
usercustomize.  To see how it works, you need first to find the location
of your user site-packages directory.  Start Python and run this code:
>>> import site
>>> site.getusersitepackages()
'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages'


Now you can create a file named usercustomize.py in that directory and
put anything you want in it.  It will affect every invocation of Python, unless
it is started with the -s option to disable the automatic import.
sitecustomize works in the same way, but is typically created by an
administrator of the computer in the global site-packages directory, and is
imported before usercustomize.  See the documentation of the site
module for more details.
