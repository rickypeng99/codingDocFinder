2.1.1. Argument PassingÂ¶
When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments
thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv
variable in the sys module.  You can access this list by executing import
sys.  The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments
are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string.  When the script name is given as
'-' (meaning  standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'.  When
-c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'.  When
-m module is used, sys.argv[0]  is set to the full name of the
located module.  Options found after  -c command or -m
module are not consumed  by the Python interpreterâs option processing but
left in sys.argv for  the command or module to handle.
