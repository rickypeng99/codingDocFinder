9.2.1. Scopes and Namespaces ExampleÂ¶
This is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes and
namespaces, and how global and nonlocal affect variable
binding:
def scope_test():
    def do_local():
        spam = "local spam"

    def do_nonlocal():
        nonlocal spam
        spam = "nonlocal spam"

    def do_global():
        global spam
        spam = "global spam"

    spam = "test spam"
    do_local()
    print("After local assignment:", spam)
    do_nonlocal()
    print("After nonlocal assignment:", spam)
    do_global()
    print("After global assignment:", spam)

scope_test()
print("In global scope:", spam)


The output of the example code is:
After local assignment: test spam
After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam
After global assignment: nonlocal spam
In global scope: global spam


Note how the local assignment (which is default) didnât change scope_testâs
binding of spam.  The nonlocal assignment changed scope_testâs
binding of spam, and the global assignment changed the module-level
binding.
You can also see that there was no previous binding for spam before the
global assignment.
