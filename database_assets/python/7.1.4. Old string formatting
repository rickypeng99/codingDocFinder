7.1.4. Old string formattingÂ¶
The % operator can also be used for string formatting. It interprets the
left argument much like a sprintf()-style format string to be applied
to the right argument, and returns the string resulting from this formatting
operation. For example:
>>> import math
>>> print('The value of pi is approximately %5.3f.' % math.pi)
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.


More information can be found in the printf-style String Formatting section.
