4.1. if StatementsÂ¶
Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement.  For
example:
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...

There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is
optional.  The keyword âelifâ is short for âelse ifâ, and is useful
to avoid excessive indentation.  An  if â¦ elif â¦
elif â¦ sequence is a substitute for the switch or
case statements found in other languages.
