2.1.2. Interactive ModeÂ¶
When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive
mode.  In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt,
usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts
with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter
prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice
before printing the first prompt:
$ python3.7
Python 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>


Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an
example, take a look at this if statement:
>>> the_world_is_flat = True
>>> if the_world_is_flat:
...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!
