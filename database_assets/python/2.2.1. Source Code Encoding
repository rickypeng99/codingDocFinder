2.2.1. Source Code EncodingÂ¶
By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.  In that
encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously
in string literals, identifiers and comments â although the standard library
only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code
should follow.  To display all these characters properly, your editor must
recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the
characters in the file.
To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line
should be added as the first line of the file.  The syntax is as follows:
# -*- coding: encoding -*-


where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.
For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first
line of your source code file should be:
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-


One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a
UNIX âshebangâ line.  In this case, the encoding
declaration should be added as the second line of the file.  For example:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

[1]On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the
executable named python, so that it does not conflict with a
simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.
