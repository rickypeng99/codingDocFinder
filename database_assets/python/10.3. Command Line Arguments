10.3. Command Line ArgumentsÂ¶
Common utility scripts often need to process command line arguments. These
arguments are stored in the sys moduleâs argv attribute as a list.  For
instance the following output results from running python demo.py one two
three at the command line:
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.argv)
['demo.py', 'one', 'two', 'three']


The getopt module processes sys.argv using the conventions of the Unix
getopt() function.  More powerful and flexible command line processing is
provided by the argparse module.
