10.12. Batteries IncludedÂ¶
Python has a âbatteries includedâ philosophy.  This is best seen through the
sophisticated and robust capabilities of its larger packages. For example:

The xmlrpc.client and xmlrpc.server modules make implementing
remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task.  Despite the modules
names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.
The email package is a library for managing email messages, including
MIME and other RFC 2822-based message documents. Unlike smtplib and
poplib which actually send and receive messages, the email package has
a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures
(including attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header
protocols.
The json package provides robust support for parsing this
popular data interchange format.  The csv module supports
direct reading and writing of files in Comma-Separated Value format,
commonly supported by databases and spreadsheets.  XML processing is
supported by the xml.etree.ElementTree, xml.dom and
xml.sax packages. Together, these modules and packages
greatly simplify data interchange between Python applications and
other tools.
The sqlite3 module is a wrapper for the SQLite database
library, providing a persistent database that can be updated and
accessed using slightly nonstandard SQL syntax.
Internationalization is supported by a number of modules including
gettext, locale, and the codecs package.
