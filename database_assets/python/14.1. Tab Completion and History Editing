14.1. Tab Completion and History EditingÂ¶
Completion of variable and module names is
automatically enabled at interpreter startup so
that the Tab key invokes the completion function; it looks at
Python statement names, the current local variables, and the available
module names.  For dotted expressions such as string.a, it will evaluate
the expression up to the final '.' and then suggest completions from
the attributes of the resulting object.  Note that this may execute
application-defined code if an object with a __getattr__() method
is part of the expression.  The default configuration also saves your
history into a file named .python_history in your user directory.
The history will be available again during the next interactive interpreter
session.
