10.8. Dates and TimesÃ‚Â¶
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in
both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the
focus of the implementation is on efficient member extraction for output
formatting and manipulation.  The module also supports objects that are timezone
aware.
>>> # dates are easily constructed and formatted
>>> from datetime import date
>>> now = date.today()
>>> now
datetime.date(2003, 12, 2)
>>> now.strftime("%m-%d-%y. %d %b %Y is a %A on the %d day of %B.")
'12-02-03. 02 Dec 2003 is a Tuesday on the 02 day of December.'

>>> # dates support calendar arithmetic
>>> birthday = date(1964, 7, 31)
>>> age = now - birthday
>>> age.days
14368
