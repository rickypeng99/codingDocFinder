6.4.2. Intra-package ReferencesÂ¶
When packages are structured into subpackages (as with the sound package
in the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings
packages.  For example, if the module sound.filters.vocoder needs to use
the echo module in the sound.effects package, it can use from
sound.effects import echo.
You can also write relative imports, with the from module import name form
of import statement.  These imports use leading dots to indicate the current and
parent packages involved in the relative import.  From the surround
module for example, you might use:
from . import echo
from .. import formats
from ..filters import equalizer


Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module.  Since
the name of the main module is always "__main__", modules intended for use
as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.
