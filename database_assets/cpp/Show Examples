C++ Arithmetic Operators






 



Try the following example to understand all the arithmetic operators available in C++.
Copy and paste the following C++ program in test.cpp file and compile and run this program.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
main() {
   int a = 21;
   int b = 10;
   int c ;
 
   c = a + b;
   cout << "Line 1 - Value of c is :" << c << endl ;
   
   c = a - b;
   cout << "Line 2 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl 
   ;
   c = a * b;
   cout << "Line 3 - Value of c is :" << c << endl ;
   
   c = a / b;
   cout << "Line 4 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
   
   c = a % b;
   cout << "Line 5 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
   
   c = a++; 
   cout << "Line 6 - Value of c is :" << c << endl ;
   
   c = a--; 
   cout << "Line 7 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
   
   return 0;
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result âˆ’

Line 1 - Value of c is :31
Line 2 - Value of c is  :11
Line 3 - Value of c is :210
Line 4 - Value of c is  :2
Line 5 - Value of c is  :1
Line 6 - Value of c is :21
Line 7 - Value of c is  :22
