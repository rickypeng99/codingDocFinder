C++ break statement






 



The 
break
 statement has the following two usages in C++ −


When the 
break
 statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.


It can be used to terminate a case in the 
switch
 statement (covered in the next chapter).


If you are using nested loops (i.e., one loop inside another loop), the break statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.
Syntax
The syntax of a break statement in C++ is −

break;

Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;

   // do loop execution
   do {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
      if( a > 15) {
         // terminate the loop
         break;
      }
   } while( a < 20 );
 
   return 0;
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
