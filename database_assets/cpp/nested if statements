C++ nested if statements






 



It is always legal to 
nest
 if-else statements, which means you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
Syntax
The syntax for a 
nested if
  statement is as follows −

if( boolean_expression 1) {
   // Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true
   if(boolean_expression 2) {
      // Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true
   }
}

You can nest 
else if...else
 in the similar way as you have nested 
if
 statement.
Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a == 100 ) {
      // if condition is true then check the following
      if( b == 200 ) {
         // if condition is true then print the following
         cout << "Value of a is 100 and b is 200" << endl;
      }
   }
   cout << "Exact value of a is : " << a << endl;
   cout << "Exact value of b is : " << b << endl;
 
   return 0;
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

Value of a is 100 and b is 200
Exact value of a is : 100
Exact value of b is : 200
