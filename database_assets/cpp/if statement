C++ if statement






 



An 
if
 statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
Syntax
The syntax of an if statement in C++ is −

if(boolean_expression) {
   // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true
}

If the boolean expression evaluates to 
true
, then the block of code inside the if statement will be executed. If  boolean expression evaluates to 
false
, then the first set of code after the end of the if statement (after the closing curly brace) will be executed.

Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a < 20 ) {
      // if condition is true then print the following
      cout << "a is less than 20;" << endl;
   }
   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl;
 
   return 0;
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

a is less than 20;
value of a is : 10
