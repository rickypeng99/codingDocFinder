C++ do...while loop






 



Unlike 
for
 and 
while
 loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the 
do...while
 loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.
A 
do...while
 loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
Syntax
The syntax of a do...while loop in C++ is −

do {
   statement(s);
} 
while( condition );

Notice that the conditional expression appears at the end of the loop, so the statement(s) in the loop execute once before the condition is tested.
If the condition is true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the statement(s) in the loop execute again. This process repeats until the  given condition becomes false.

Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;

   // do loop execution
   do {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
   } while( a < 20 );
 
   return 0;
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
